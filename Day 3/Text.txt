Post Man :

-> we use the pst man for making the API's 
-> its give all the neccessory infomartion related to the API development
-> when we request to the server and server send the response back in postman we can see the timing also . Many more information we can see the postman

Nodemon : 

-> this is used for starting the server 
-> in node server.js if we make any update in our code then we have restart the server
-> but in nodemon we don't need to restartthe server it automatically update it
-> "npx nodemon server.js" we use this command to run nodemon

npm -> Node Package Manager
npx -> Node Package Executor

->  npx id doesn't need installation for running the Package 

Methodsin REST API

-> GET : to get data from the server

-> Post : (sending data from the frontend to backend)to send the data to the server(creating new resources(user account , comment , post creation , product creation etc ))

-> PATCH : to update data on the server

-> DELETE : to remove data from the server


Way to Send Data in Requests :

=> req.body :

-> it is best for larger or complex or sensitive data like passwords
-> we genereally used with POST,PUT,PATCH request
-> express doesn't read req.body by default we have to use middleware
