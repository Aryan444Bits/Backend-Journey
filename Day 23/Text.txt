Embed JavaScript (EJS) :

-> in the ejs we can design frontend from backed

-> for usng ejs we have to intsall an package npm i ejs

-> we have to tell the express that you have t0 use view engine that is ejs

-> we have to make an view folder and in view folder we have to make file with extension .ejs and we can whatever name of the file what we want. I n that file we can write our HTML code 

-> use logger which tell us what is going on the server, there are different types of the logger i am going with morgan

-> use the moran as the middelware which gives you the information what is going on your server in different mode (combined,dev,short,common,tiny)

-> res.render("index"); if you not sending the response from the server then nothing will shown on the web browser and one more thing to be mention is that file name ("<ejs file name>") is must be same

-> delimiters : there 6 different types of delimiters in ejs, wtih the delimiters we can easily get the message which was send from the backend to the frontendwe can easily render on it.

<% code %> : Scriplet -> runs js code no output to page

<%= value %> : Ecsaped output -> print the value, HTML is Ecsaped(take html tag as a text)

<%- value %> : Unescaped output -> print raw HTML(takes html tag as a html code)
